title: Qualcomm Trusted Execution Environment UEFI Secure Application

maintainers:

description: |
  Various Qualcomm SoCs do not allow direct access to UEFI variables. Instead,
  these need to be accessed via the UEFI Secure Application (uefisecapp),
  residing in the Trusted Execution Environment (TrEE). These bindings mark the
  presence of uefisecapp and allow the respective client driver to load and
  install efivar operations, providing the kernel with access to UEFI
  variables.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: qcom,tee-uefisecapp

    firmware {

        tee-uefisecapp {
            compatible = "qcom,tee-uefisecapp";
        };
